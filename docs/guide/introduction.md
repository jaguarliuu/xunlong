# What is XunLong?

**XunLong** (寻龙, meaning "Dragon Seeker") is an AI-powered multi-modal content generation system that automates the creation of research reports, creative fiction, and professional presentations.

## The Vision

In today's information age, content creation is both crucial and time-consuming. Whether you're a researcher compiling findings, a writer crafting stories, or a professional preparing presentations, the process often involves:

- 🔍 **Hours of research** - Searching, reading, and extracting relevant information
- ✍️ **Manual writing** - Organizing thoughts and crafting coherent narratives  
- 🎨 **Formatting** - Designing layouts and ensuring visual appeal
- 🔄 **Iterations** - Revising and refining until satisfactory

**XunLong automates this entire workflow**, allowing you to generate professional-quality content in minutes instead of hours.

## What Makes XunLong Different?

### 1. Multi-Modal Generation

Unlike single-purpose AI tools, XunLong supports **three distinct content types**:

| Mode | Purpose | Output Formats |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Report** | Research reports, analysis documents, white papers | MD, HTML, PDF, DOCX |
| **Fiction** | Novels, short stories, creative writing | MD, HTML, PDF, DOCX |
| **PPT** | Business presentations, pitch decks, slides | JSON, HTML, PPTX |

### 2. Intelligence Through Multi-Agent Architecture

XunLong doesn't rely on a single AI prompt. Instead, it orchestrates **multiple specialized agents** that collaborate:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Request] --> B[Coordinator]
    B --> C[Search Agent]
    B --> D[Generation Agent]
    B --> E[Review Agent]
    C --> F[Results]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[High-Quality Output]
    
    style B fill:#ff6b6b,color:#fff
    style F fill:#51cf66,color:#fff
```

- **Coordinator** - Breaks down complex tasks
- **Search Agent** - Gathers relevant information
- **Generation Agent** - Creates content
- **Review Agent** - Ensures quality
- **Iteration Agent** - Refines based on feedback

### 3. Real Web Search

XunLong doesn't hallucinate facts. It performs **actual web searches** using Playwright and Perplexity to gather current, factual information before generating content.

### 4. Iterative Refinement

Not satisfied with the initial output? XunLong supports **intelligent iterations**:

```bash
# Initial generation
python xunlong.py report "AI Industry 2025"

# Iterate and refine
python xunlong.py iterate <project_id> "Add more case studies in chapter 3"
```

The system understands context and makes targeted modifications without regenerating everything.

### 5. Full Observability

Every LLM call, search query, and generation step is tracked via **LangFuse integration**, giving you complete transparency into how content is created.

## Use Cases
